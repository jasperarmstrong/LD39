# Ludum Dare 39 Entry - The Day The Robots Attacked

The Day The Robots Attacked is a game in which you are a man stuck in a room with a big EMP (messes with electronic stuff), in some sort of a military facility. For some reason, robots have decided to attack that room in particular, and to make matters worse, the only door is locked. Luckily, the door is locked only by a sort of electronic mechanism, so if you can figure out how to set off the EMP, you may be able to unlock the door and escape. Using a laser gun to fight, and spare batteries that were lying around to charge the EMP, you will find a way to hold off this horde of robots and escape with your life. This was made for Ludum Dare 39 (Running Out of Power).
